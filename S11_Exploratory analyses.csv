"ARR: absolute risk reduction; OR: odds ratio; Some are not OR, eg, HR for uncalibrated comet and topcat, Risk ratio for dig; arm1 vs arm2: carvedilol vs metoprolol in COMET, digoxin vs placebo in DIG, spironolactone vs placebo in TOPCAT. The number of low probability not included in IPSW is less than 1% in each trial, specifically, 22 (0.73%) for overall COMET,  1 (0.01%) for overall DIG, 23 (0.67%) for overall TOPCAT; 2(0.07%), 0 (0%), 2 (0.03%), 1 (0.03%) for low risk decile COMET death, dora, DIG and TOPCAT respectively; 1 (0.03%), 8 (0.26%), 1 (0.01%), 6 (0.17%) for high risk decile for COMET death, dora, DIG and TOPCAT respectively.
